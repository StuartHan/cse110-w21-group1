# Site Additional Features

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Everyone is present

## Context and Problem Statement

The Web App as it currently stands is too basic with little additional features. We would like to
do a makeover of the website that is not detracting from the user's experience whilee also giving them a wider range of options.

## Decision Drivers
1. Must be non-hindering features added to the website - features should not take away from the user's attention
2. Features shouldn't be cluttered - interface should remain intuitive and clear
3. Usability of the website must be kept.

## Considered Options

1. Store feature where coins are awarded everytime a user completes a Pomodoro or cycle. 
2. User should maybe have an option to select custom sounds - also perhaps a store function? 
3. Seperate statistics page for user to keep track of their status and history.

## Decision Outcome

We'll implement all the options here, but keep option 3 and option 2 minimal because we don't want to clutter the UI or have an overflow of features.

### Positive Consequences

- More incentive for users to use the app
- Gives users the option of selecting their own preferences
- Retains full usability of the web application

### Negative Consequences

- We'll need to position the features in such a way that they don't detract from the user's attention too much in the UI.
