## Context and Problem Statement

The Web App as it currently stands looks outdated and subpar compared to other Pomodoro timers available. We would like to
do a makeover of the website that is not distracting to the user yet more appealing to the eye.

## Decision Drivers
1. Must be non-distracting additions to the website - colors should not detract from the user's attention
2. Must be appealing to users with the option of changing styling to their own preferences
3. Usability of the website must remain the same

## Considered Options

1. Static background for the website - would be non-distracting yet colorful element of website
2. Option for users to change background and into a blurred version, gives more options to the user while completing the same goal
3. Store feature to help incentivize user into using the application more and also getting the appealing factor.

## Decision Outcome

Option 3 because it has the most positive consequences while fully retaining the usability of the website. This option will incentivize
the user to keep using the pomodoro timer while also adding to the visiblee styling of the web application.

### Positive Consequences

- More incentive for users to use the app
- Gives users the option of selecting their own preferences
- Retains full usability of the web application

### Negative Consequences

- We'll have to figure out a way to implement a store system that won't interfere with overall usability and won't be hindering
the user's ability to use the Pomodoro timer.
