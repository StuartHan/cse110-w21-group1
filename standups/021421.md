### Kevin:
For my standup contribution, I'll be continuing preparations for the presentation that I'll be giving on Tuesday for all we've done so far.

### Stuart:
- Today: I made many progressions today! I've created a countdown timer with 3 modes using HTML, JS, and simple CSS. Besides, I made detailed examples of styling.
- Tomorrow: I'll first meeting with everyone in coding team. We plan to divide our specific roles and upload current codes to GitHub. Then if I have time, I plan to draw a draft of website, let timer switch mode automatically, and make total time correspond to modes.
- For changing settings (time, colors, etc), shadow DOM, and login stuffs. We'll do them later.

### Guo:
I'll be working on some other class's project so I won't be doing much. Will come back to this tomorrow.

### Jiahang:
