# March 8

I translated Doge shop and login pages and put language into localStorage today. I'll stop revising features by now and move to testing starting tomorrow. (That's weird that our tests works at first but crashed when adding more test cases...)

I'll be pushing the full teams features with the UI changes you guys requested before midnight today PST. I'll try and see if I can get this bug fixed for us around then as well

### Jiahang:
Have some jest test. Attended the meeting.
