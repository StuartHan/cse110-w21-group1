### Yolanda:
Organize and push todayâ€™s standup

### Jiahang:
Work on the lab. And push my contribution to our project to github.

### Stuart:
Added checks on input values in Settings so that users cannot run a 10000-minute timer or "str" working phrases.
But cannot pull or push right now, might because of the Status Video.

### Jiaming:

Deleting unnecessary inline translations
