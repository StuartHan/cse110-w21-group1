#Feb 15

### Kevin:
I couldn't contribute today due to some unexpected personal events, but I'll be continuing work for the group tomorrow.

### Stuart:
- Today, I hold a meeting with our coding team. We give everyone tasks. I'll focus on mode changing, Bo'll work on user interface, and Jiaming with Jiahang will figure out how to implement the setting window (ie. using pop-up window).
- Tomorrow, I will upload current codes to GitHub and assign work using GitHub work flow (I was supposed to do that today but there's an urgent deadline coming up, sorry...). I also plan to chat with Kevin so we can have a better presentation on Tue. 

### Yolanda:
Organize and push todayâ€™s standups. Observe more on JS.

### Guo:
Learning more about web component and reviewing labs.

### Ethan:
Study more about lab 6 (web components and localstorage stuff)

### Jiahang:
Learn about the lectures and find some more examples about settings in our timer.
