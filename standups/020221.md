### Kevin: 
I communicated with Deepak and got the following information about the project:

- Confirmed that App will not require that much backend we may be able to move one backend person to front end
- Discuss roles needed for the project
- Details about backend to follow shortly

### Yolanda: 
I researched on google about how to effectively organize team standups on github and will implement the strategies today when everybody has their standup submitted. I also jotted down some note about the incomplete brainstorm activities. I will present them during our next brainstorm meeting.

### Guo:
