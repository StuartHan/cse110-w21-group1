### Kevin:
For my standup contribution, I'm preparing for the presentation that I'll be giving on Tuesday for all we've done so far.

### Stuart:
Sorry I was not making contributions to CSE 110 today as I was cramming another CSE homework and also new year stuff spent me some time (I'm badly overwhelmed this week...). I hope to be back to coding the project this weekend, so we can have some output on Sunday's meeting and next week's presentation. Any way, happy lunar new year!!!

### Yolanda:
Organize and push todayâ€™s standups. Continue working on lab6.

### Jiahang:
I am really busy with another CSE midterm exam these days. But I will go through onstorage today and plan to begin back-end coding tomorrow. Happy New Year!

### Guo:
Completing Lab6 and also exploring more of javascript.
