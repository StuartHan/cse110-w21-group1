2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

- All group communication will be on Slack which team members must check daily and all meetings must be scheduled at least 2 days in advance.
- All members are required to attend meetings on time and the Group Coordinators must be informed of their absence at least one day in advance.

3) Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)

- In principle, meetings are organized at a weekly frequency. Arrange meeting time according to team members&#39; time zone negotiation every weekend.
- In case of special circumstances requiring additional meetings, all members need to respond within 12 hours of the notification.
- All the members take turns to notify the meeting time of this week within 12 hours after the end of the course, and coordinate according to the actual situation.
- If a member is unable to attend the meeting due to force majeure, he should inform the person in charge this week 12 hours before the start of the meeting, and the person in charge shall make appropriate records.

4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members

- Complete the tasks assigned on time or notify the group coordinators 3 days before the deadline if there is any difficulty.
- Speak out rather than be silent. Always let the group know if you have any questions / problems / suggestions / progressions.

5) Conflict Resolution

- Time conflict: every group member is expected to attend every meeting, but if someone has to be absent in a meeting due to a schedule conflict, group coordinators need to provide a summarization of the meeting right after the meeting and he/she should go over the meeting minutes later.
- Group members should be aware of deadlines and the workload and keep up with each other constantly. If a member is not meeting deadlines, future plans of tasks need to be adjusted immediately. But if this harms a group project, the group will summarize the situation and report it to TA for resolution.

6) Expectations of Faculty and TA&#39;s

- If a problem is reported to the staff, our team will work with faculties to address it and be responsible for submitting a completed assignment.
- Faculties also need to remind meetings/tasks as early as possible to avoid delay due to time zones or packed schedules.
